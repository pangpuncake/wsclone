Wireshark clone

## Overview

This project aims to help the programmers learn about network fundamentals, throughout the entire network stack. 
The project consists of building a WireShark-like application that is able to sniff network packets and provide some details/visualisation on the network traffic between the user’s hardware and the internet.

## Possible Future Plans

- Provide routing capabilities for specific applications (not the entire network traffic), e.g. tunneling / VPN.
    - Set up a server to serve such a purpose (AWS, home server, etc)
- Provide a GUI for visualisation
    - Graphs for specific application
